# Implementation-of-Convolutional-Neural-Network
In this notebook, we design Convolutional Neural Network for classification task on two datasets. We will first implement Convolutional Neural Network in Python and then study the effect of pooling, dropout, batch normalization and learning rate for a classifcation task. <br>
The two datasets are: <br>
(a) cifar10 <br>
(b) Bricklane <br>
